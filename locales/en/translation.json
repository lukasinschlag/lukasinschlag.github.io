The primary goal was to integrate different technologies, that are available for Android.\nThese were for example: Google Place API (Geofencing), Google AdMob, Room for data persistence and various material components.",
    "desc2": "Simple Schedule started out as a project to improve my skills in JAVA at the beginning of my studies. Aside from that, I felt that there was quite no app that could properly help organizing my timeschedule for university.\nBy including a Google+ test community, the feature request became more and more. With this, the - at the beginning very simple project - grow quite complex quickly.\nDue to increasing workload at my studies I had to stop actively developing this app, but I definitely learned quite alot during this time.",
    "desc3": "For my bachelor thesis I researched the topic of mobile sales processes and how mobile apps can improve this process. Together with a colleague I then developed an Android app to test out the possibilities such an app can provide.\nFor the full details, I have included my thesis here for interested readers.",
